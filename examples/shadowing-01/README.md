  Starter for the official Gatsby blog theme
</h1>

Quickly get started using the Gatsby blog theme! This starter creates a new Gatsby site that is preconfigured to work with the [official Gatsby blog theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-blog).

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog theme starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog theme starter
    gatsby new my-themed-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-themed-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    To get started, check out the guide to [using the Gatsby blog theme starter](http://gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme), or the longer, [more detailed tutorial](http://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme).

## 🧐 What's inside?

Here are the top-level files and directories you'll see in a site created using the blog theme starter:

```
gatsby-starter-blog-theme
├── content
│ ├── assets
│ │ └── avatar.png
│ └── posts
│ ├── hello-world.mdx
│ └── my-second-post.mdx
├── src
│ └── gatsby-theme-blog
│ ├── components
│ │ └── bio-content.js
│ └── gatsby-theme-ui
│ └── colors.js
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierrc
├── gatsby-config.js
├── LICENSE
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

1.  **`/content`**: A content folder holding assets that the theme expects to exist. This will vary from theme to theme -- this starter is set up to get you started with the blog theme, which expects an image asset for your avatar, and blog post content. Replace the avatar image file, delete the demo posts, and add your own!

2.  **`/src`**: You will probably want to customize your site to personalize it. The files under `/src/gatsby-theme-blog` _shadow_, or override, the files of the same name in the `gatsby-theme-blog` package. To learn more about this, check out the [guide to getting started with using the blog theme starter](http://gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme).

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This file tells [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) which configuration it should use to lint files.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. When using themes, it's where you'll include the theme plugin, and any customization options the theme provides.

6.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

7.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

8.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

9.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
