# Gatsby Theme Examples

Examples of various patterns for Gatsby themes.

## Running an example:

```
yarn
yarn workspace shadowing-01 develop
```

The original purpose of this repo was for when I was developing the original implementation of Gatsby themes, so if you look far back in the history you may see some early code as I have not deleted any of the old commits.
